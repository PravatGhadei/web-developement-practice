What is document.write()and how to use?
=>Write directly to the HTML document.
What is prompt()and how to use?
=>Creates an dialogue for user input.
1.What is variable ?
=>Variable(var) are containers which hold reusable data .
2.How to declare and initialize variable in js?
=>it is basic unit of storage in a program.
3.Scope and life time of variable ?
=>The value stored in a variable can bechanged during program execution.
             -:Scope of Variable:-
.Variable declared within a function are local to that function.
.Variable declared outside of any function are global variables.
			-:Life Time of a variable:-	
.Local variable's life time is within the block of its declaration.
.Global variable's life time is throughout the program.
DOM-Document object method.			

	What is an operator?
	---------------------
An operator is a symbol that tell the compiler which arthmetic or logical operation to be performed between the respective operands.

Types of operators?
Arithmetic.ex- +,-,*,/,%,++,--
Logical -Human logic
Ternary-
Assignment-
Comparison-==,!=,>,>=,<=
What are functions ?
.Function are group of code or program which is used more often.
.It leads programming to code reusability and clean code. 
Type of function:
1.Pre defined-Such functions are defined at the time of making of any language.
2.User defined-Such functionare defined by users according to their needs.

What are conditional statements?
.Conditional statements(control statements)used to change the flow of the program's excution.
		-:Types of conditional statements in js...
.(If)-it proved true,performs a function or displays information.
If-else=.If proved true,performs a task.
		.If false performs any other task.
If-elseif=.If proved true,performs a task.
		  .If false checks another if condition.
		 Syntax:
		 If (condition) {
		 //block of code to be excuted
		 //If the condition is true
		 }
		 Syntax:
		 //else if code to be excuted if 
		 //the condition1 is false and condition2
		 //is true
		 Syntax:
		 else{
		 //block of code to be executed
		 //If the condition is false
		 }
	What is an array?
1.Array is a group of continuous memory locations.
2.It is used to store multiple values into a single variable.	
multiple value ko single variable ke andar store karna he.
		What is loop ?
.A loop is used to repeat a block of code until the specified condition is met.
.When similar task is needed to be done again and again.
.Save time and leads to code reusability.
For loop in Javascript.
Syntax:
for(initilization:test condition:+ement/-ement)
{
//statement(s)to be executed if test
//condition is true
}
Example:
for(var count=0; count<10;count++ )

{
document.write(count +"Wellcome to Wscube Tech <br>");
}
		What is while loop?
.A while loop is to execute a statement or code blockrepeatedly as long as Condition is true.

.Once the Condition becomes false.the loop terminates.
It is also called entry control loop.
Syntax:
while(expression){
//Statement(s) to executed it 
//expression is true
}
If(condition){
//block of code to be executed 
//if the condition is true
}else{
//block of code to be excuted
//if the condition is false
}
Syntax:
If(condition1){
//block of code to be executed 
//if the condition is true
}else if(condition2) {
//block of code to be excuted if
//the condition1 is false and condition2
//is true
}else{
// block of code to be excuted if 
//the condition1 is false and //condition2
//is false
}
What is a for Each loop ?
1.A forEach loop (method) is used to get data from JS array or object.
2.The method calls a function once for each element in an array.In order.
Syntax:
Ex-Var cars =["car1" , "car2" , "car3"];
cars.forEach(myfunction);
function myfunction(item,index,array){
//body of the function
}
item -(here "car1")required parameter
index -(here 0 for"car1")opitional
/**if( 5>6){
document.write("Hii");
}else{
document.write("hello")
}**/
